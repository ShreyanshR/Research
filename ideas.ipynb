    "What do I need to do:\n",
    "1. Get Data of 3-7 type of asset class or asset which I want in my portfolio\n",
    "2. Then I have to weight them and backtest them for last 5 years for different weights\n",
    "3. And see which kind of allocation is good to my needs\n",

    "\n",
    "My idea:\n",
    "I am super bullish on Equites & AI, so, I want 40-50% on equity\n",
    "and on that on that 50% of equity it should be AI & Tech, but I have to do a lot of research for that\n",
    "10-15%: TLT & Bonds\n",
    "10%: Crypto\n",
    "10-15%: Precious Metals: Gold & Silver\n",
    "10%: some speculation\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I can risk maybe more on equity, but then I will invest in some SPY etf, as in 25% of that allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is: 25%(Equity ETF) + 35%(AI & Tech: 25%, Value: 10%) + 15%(TLT & Bonds) + 10%(crypto) + 10%(gold & Silver)\n",
    "\n",
    "How much leverage I want? 2x-3x, that's what I am comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Vol: I want b/w 15-20%, but maybe that's a lot non? Idk, because it's aroudn 1.5% per day, so I will decide.\n",
